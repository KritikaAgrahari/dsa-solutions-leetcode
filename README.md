# LeetCode DSA Solutions

Welcome to **LeetCode DSA Solutions**! This repository contains solutions to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems on LeetCode, organized by topic. The solutions cover a wide range of common DSA concepts essential for coding interviews and competitive programming.

## Repository Overview

This repository is designed to help you master DSA concepts by practicing with curated problems on LeetCode. Each solution is structured to enhance your understanding of different data structures and algorithms, ranging from basic arrays to advanced graph traversal techniques.

### Topics Covered

Here are the major DSA topics covered in this repository:

- **Arrays**: Problems involving array manipulation, sorting, sliding windows, and more.
- **Binary Search**: Efficient searching techniques, including variations for complex scenarios.
- **Hash Tables**: Hash-based solutions for fast lookups and handling collisions.
- **Strings**: String manipulation, pattern matching, and encoding/decoding challenges.
- **Linked Lists**: Operations on singly and doubly linked lists, reversing, and merging lists.
- **Stacks & Queues**: Stack-based solutions, queue operations, and applications of these data structures.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, traversals, and tree-based algorithms.
- **Graphs**: Graph traversal (BFS, DFS), shortest path, and graph connectivity problems.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Optimized solutions for problems with overlapping subproblems.
- **Other Topics**: Additional DSA topics such as backtracking, bit manipulation, and sorting.

### Coming Soon

We regularly update this repository with solutions to new problems and topics as they become available on LeetCode.

## Structure

Each solution file includes:
1. **Problem Description**: A summary of the problem statement.
2. **Solution**: The implementation of the solution in code.
3. **Explanation**: A detailed breakdown of the approach, algorithm used, and time/space complexity analysis.

## Getting Started

To get the most out of this repository, we recommend:
1. Reviewing each topic sequentially or focusing on specific areas you want to improve.
2. Practicing each solution directly on LeetCode to test your understanding.
3. Exploring the explanations to gain insights into the thought process behind each solution.

### Prerequisites

- **Basic DSA Knowledge**: Familiarity with fundamental data structures and algorithms will be helpful.
- **LeetCode Account**: You can find the problems directly on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) to practice and submit your solutions.
